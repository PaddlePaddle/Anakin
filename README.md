Welcome to the Anakin GitHub.

Anakin is an cross-platform, high-performance inference engine, which is originally
developed by Baidu engineers and is a large-scale application of industrial products.

Please refer to our [release announcement]() to track the latest feature of Anakin.

## Features

- **Flexibility**

    Anakin supports a wide range of neural network architectures and
    diffrent hardware platform. It is easy to run Anakin at GPU/x86/ARM platform.

-  **High performance**

    In order to giving full play to the performance of hardware, we optimize the
    forward prediction at diffrent levels.
      - Automatic graph fusion. The goal of all performance optimization under a 
      given algorithm is to make ALU as busy as possible, Operator fusion 
      can effectively reduce memory access and keep ALU busy.
      
      - Memory reuse. Forward prediction is a one-way calculation. We reuse 
      the memory between the input and output of different operators, thus 
      reducing the overall memory overhead.

      - Assembly level optimization. Saber is Anakin's underlying DNN library, which
      is deeply optimized at assembly level. Performance comparison between Anakin, TensorRT
      and Tensorflow-lite, please refer to the benchmark tests.
